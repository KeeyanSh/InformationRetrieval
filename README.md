# Information Retrieval System on News

## Overview
This project is an advanced information retrieval system designed to index, query, and rank news articles effectively. By implementing techniques such as TF-IDF weighting and vector space models, the system aims to deliver high precision and recall in document retrieval, making it a powerful tool for managing large collections of news data.

## Features
- **Document Indexing**: Efficiently indexes news articles to enable fast and accurate retrieval. The indexing process involves parsing text data, and organizing them into a searchable format.
- **TF-IDF Weighting**: Utilizes Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) to assess the importance of terms within documents relative to the entire corpus. This method enhances the relevance of search results by prioritizing significant terms.
- **Vector Space Models**: Implements vector space models to represent documents and queries as vectors in a multi-dimensional space. This allows the system to calculate the similarity between documents and queries, facilitating accurate retrieval.
- **Query Optimization**: Optimizes search queries to improve performance and retrieval accuracy. The system analyzes user queries to deliver the most relevant documents, minimizing search time and maximizing precision.
